# Aviation Accidents Analysis README

## Overview
This README provides an overview of an analysis of aviation accident data. The analysis includes visualizations and insights derived from the dataset.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholder and Key Business Questions
Stakeholders include aviation safety regulators, airline operators, and aviation safety researchers. Key business questions addressed by the analysis include:
- What are the trends in aviation accidents over the years?
- Which aircraft categories and regions are associated with the highest risk of accidents?
- How severe are the injuries typically resulting from aviation accidents?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of Data
The data used for analysis is sourced from an aviation accident dataset. It includes information on accident dates, locations, aircraft details, injury severity, and other relevant factors.

### Description of Data
The dataset contains structured information including:
- Event ID
- Investigation Type
- Accident Number
- Event Date
- Location
- Country
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Airport Code
- Injury Severity
- Aircraft Damage
- Aircraft Category
- Registration Number
- Make and Model
- Number of Engines
- Engine Type
- Weather Conditions
- Phase of Flight
- Report Status
- Publication Date, etc.

## Three Visualizations
### Visualization 1: Number of Accidents per Year
A line plot showing the trend in the number of aviation accidents per year.

### Visualization 2: Risk Assessment by Aircraft Category
A bar plot depicting the risk scores calculated for different aircraft categories based on the severity of accidents.

### Visualization 3: Top 20 Risky Regions by Accident Frequency
A bar plot illustrating the top 20 regions (countries) with the highest frequency of aviation accidents, ranked by their risk scores.

## Conclusion
### Summary of Conclusions
1. **Increasing Trend in Accidents:** The analysis reveals a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in aviation accidents over recent decades.
   
2. **High-Risk Aircraft Categories:** Certain aircraft categories such as small private planes show higher risk scores due to fatal accidents.

3. **Regional Risk Variability:** There is significant variability in aviation accident frequencies across different regions, with some regions consistently showing higher accident rates.
